part 2:
why were the first two choices marked as q.whatever and

the front end is automatically generated, but where?
and where/how can we edit it?

tab indentations are SUPER important. 
things won't work if they're indented improperly 
(throws "This site can't be reached")

what do we use the django shell vs write into test.py?
    I guess it's to check to make sure a given test case actually 
    works, and then you write out the actual test in your test.py
